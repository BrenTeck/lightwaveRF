# For the Electric Switch LW934      
# At the moment the On and Off switches are independant so you have to switch it On using the On switch.
# Switch it off by switching the On switch to Off and the Off switch to On.
# When switching back On switch the Off switch to Off and the on switch to On.
# I will work on an auto script for this in the future.
